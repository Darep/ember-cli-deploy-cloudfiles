# ember-deploy-cloudfiles 

This is the cloudfiles-adapter implementation to use [cloudfiles](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files) with
[ember-deploy](https://github.com/levelbossmike/ember-deploy).

This is an unapologetic clone of the s3-adapter with just enough changed to get it working.

TODO:
- Tests
- Better error handling
- Check for container and create it if it doesn't already exist
